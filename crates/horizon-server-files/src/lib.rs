//! The dedicated server's files and settings, ported from
//! net.minecraft.server.dedicated and net.minecraft.server.players:
//! server.properties, eula.txt, the four user lists, usercache.json and
//! looking players up by name. The game's dedicated server
//! (`horizon-client --dedicated`) reads them, and `horizon-server` manages
//! them; this crate needs neither a window nor the game.
// The browser's stand-in for ureq: the same calls, every request failing as if offline.
